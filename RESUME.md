# Session Recovery Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: This file is automatically shown after context compaction via SessionStart hook.

## Required Actions

Read these files immediately to recover session state:

1. **context.md** - What we're working on, key decisions made
2. **todos.md** - Task progress, what's done vs pending
3. **insights.md** - Accumulated learnings and patterns

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Read all persistence files
cat context.md todos.md insights.md
```

## After Reading

1. Acknowledge what you found ("I've recovered the session state...")
2. Summarize current goal and progress
3. Continue where we left off
